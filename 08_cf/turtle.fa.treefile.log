Time:    Thu Jul 27 09:44:18 2023
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (20 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 20 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

WARNING: You probably want the --scfl option. The site concordance factor
 implemented with the --scf option is based on parsimony (described here:
 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa106). It has since been superseded by a more
 accurate likelihood-based approach which is implemented in the --scfl option, and
 is described in the paper "Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of
 homoplasy and taxon sampling" by Yu et al.. Please see the tutorial here for more
